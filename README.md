# 100 days of code

Please join me on my journey of writting code for 100 days.

As this is to motivate me or someone out there, I will try my best to write simple code.

These are not tutorials, it just my comeback in writting code and showing off :joy: :joy: :joy: .

All the code will be available on [github](https://github.com/brixmavu/100-Days-of-Code)
